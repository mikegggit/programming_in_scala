// == vs eq
/*
== is used for natrual equality
eq is used for object equality
*/

// Value types vs ref types
/*
for val types, == compares value
for ref types, compares natural equality as defined
in equals method

The Any class defines equals.

The default inherited equals method performs equality
based on object identity, just like in Java.

It is not possible to override == as it is declared
as final in the Any class.
