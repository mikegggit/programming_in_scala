/*
By including function parameters in an API, you open up a 
lot of possibilities.

You can see the benefits of this type of design in the
collections API.

- map
- exists
- filter
- foreach

each of these methods encapsulate a certain looping pattern 
and parameterize to be done on each loop.
*/

/*
take "exists" as an example...

"exists" accepts a function to be applied to all elements
of a collection until it is applied to an element returning
true.
