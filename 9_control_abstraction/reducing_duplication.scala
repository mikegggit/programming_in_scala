/*
higher order functions - functions which take other functions as parameters.

typically in a function, there is "common" code that gets executed every time 
the function is called, and uncommon code, which is provided via parameters or
triggered as a by-product of certain parameter values being evaluated.

with higher order functions, you can pass in entire algorithms as a parameter.
