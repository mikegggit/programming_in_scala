/*
first class functions are functions that are treated 
the same as other types in terms of...
- passing to other functions as parameters
- being returned as a return value
- refer to as a literal

A literal is a syntactic mechanism for declaring a function
without needing to bind it to a variable reference.

It is simply a blueprint to be "used" at compile time.  A
function literal is transformed into a more concrete
form at compile-time.

At compile time, scala converts function literals into 
instances of FunctionX, in essence creating function values.

A function value can be returned, passed around, etc.
