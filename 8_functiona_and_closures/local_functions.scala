/*
Functional programming style encourages breaking up 
logic into small functions that do a well-defined task.

Local functions are useful for representing functions
that help an api function and yet is not to be shared
with clients.

Without local functions, one would pollute the namespace 
with code not intended to be called by anyone but an 
implementation.
