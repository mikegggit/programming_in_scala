/*
well designed systems are broken up into composable pieces.

Scala supports a variety of ways to divide up control flow.

To divide control flow is to encapsulate execution paths into 
composable code.

Certain control flow is provided using built-in constructs
like if, while, try/catch, and for expressions, to name some 
of the most prevalent.

Otherwise, clients may provide their own control flow design
using various functional constructs.

- methods
- nested functions
- function literals
- function values
