/*
If you want to write a java class that inherits from a code
unit, make it an abstract class.  It's tricky for a java
class to inherit from a scala trait.

If you want to reuse the code unit in a variety of places
in the class hierarchy, use a trait.

If the code unit isn't reused anywhere, just put it in
a concrete class.

If you're not sure how the code will be used, default to
a trait.
