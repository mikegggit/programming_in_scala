/*
The names Set and Map are shared by several traits in the collections hierarchy.

By default, Set and Map return immutable types.

In order to access mutable versions, you need to explicitly
import a separate package.

This is a common pattern in scala, to provide easy access
to the immutable versions and require explicit reference
to any immutable version.

Easy access to immutable access is enabled via the PreDef
default import.
